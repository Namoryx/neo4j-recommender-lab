# neo4j-recommender-lab

An interactive web-based codex to master graph-based recommender systems with Neo4j & Cypher.

## Design overview
- **Game-first learning loop:** concept → mission (query/code) → auto-grading → instant feedback → next stage.
- **Core focus:** AI recommendations + GraphRAG fundamentals; domain DLCs (news/legal/10K/ETF) arrive later.
- **Result-based grading:** never compare query strings; validate outputs, shapes, and tolerances.
